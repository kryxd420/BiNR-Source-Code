Source code of a fixed version of "Bendy in The Nightmare Run"

This source code correspond to the version 1.4.3676 fixed by TheMaidS2, i just decompiled it.
im working on a modded version of the APK to have infinity shit and stuff because fuck grindind.

This game was originally published on 2017 but discontinued on 2021 due to Karman interactive demanding Joey Drew Studios (AKA Kindly Beast AKA TheMeatly games).

The situation of other version of JDWS games on phones is terrible, Bendy And The Ink Machine cant be found anymore on the Play Store beacuse it was build for a old version of Android and Boris And The Dark survival was deleted but before that it was suffering the same problem as BATIM Android.

Note: i can decompile more source codes (even PC games versions) since it doesnt take any skills, but right now my focus is on the Android versions.

Fuck this saga, been following it since day 1.
